title: Roadmap
description: Current state of Olyx and where we're headed next
---

**Olyx** is a modern React component library built on **Base UI primitives**, designed for developers who need accessible, customizable components without the complexity. Unlike traditional component libraries that lock you into a specific styling system, Olyx gives you full control through CSS custom properties and data attributes, while maintaining accessibility and usability standards out of the box.

Our goal is to provide a **complete set of production-ready components** that work seamlessly together, backed by battle-tested Base UI primitives and a thoughtful design token system. Every component is copy-paste friendly — no bloat, just clean code you own.

## Current Status

- **50+ UI primitives** already available, with more on the way.
- A **growing particle collection** designed to match and exceed Olyx UI.

## What's Next

#### Color System Components

Building a complete color manipulation toolkit:

- **Color Area** — 2D color space picker (hue + saturation)
- **Color Field** — Text input with color validation
- **Color Slider** — 1D color value adjustment (hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)
- **Color Swatch** — Single color display with accessibility info
- **Color Swatch Picker** — Preset color palette selection
- **Color Picker** — Complete color selection interface combining all color primitives

#### Advanced Components

- **Calendar** — Date display with locale support
- **Date Picker** — Date selection with keyboard navigation
- **Date Range Picker** — Start/end date selection
- **Time Picker** — Time selection with various formats
- **File Upload** — Drag-and-drop file input with preview
- **Data Table** — Sortable, filterable, paginated tables
- **Carousel** — Image/content slider with touch support
