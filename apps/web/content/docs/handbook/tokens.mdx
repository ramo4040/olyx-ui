## Introduction

<div style={{backgroundColor:"red"}}>
    Tokens are the building blocks of design systems. They are the visual design atoms of the design system — specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. These attributes can be anything from color values to typography styles, spacing values, and more. By using tokens, designers and developers can ensure consistency across a product or brand, as they can reference these tokens instead of hardcoding values directly into their designs or code.
