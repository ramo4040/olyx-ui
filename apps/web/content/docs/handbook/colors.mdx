Olyx uses an **HCT-inspired color system** built entirely in CSS custom properties. You set a single brand color — the rest is generated automatically with WCAG AA accessible contrast baked in.

No JavaScript. No build step. Just CSS variables.

## HCT Color Space

The system is based on [Material Design 3's HCT color space](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/system/how-the-system-works), which defines colors using three dimensions:

| Dimension | What it controls | Range |
|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| **Hue** | The color itself (red, blue, green...) | `0–360` (circular) |
| **Chroma** | How vivid or muted the color is | `0` (grey) → `~120` (most vivid) |
| **Tone** | Lightness/darkness — **this is what drives contrast** | `0` (black) → `100` (white) |

The key insight: **tone directly maps to perceived lightness**, which makes accessible contrast pairings predictable. Two colors with a tone difference ≥ 40 reliably produce ≥ 3:1 contrast. That's the entire trick.

Our implementation approximates HCT using HSL with clamped saturation and computed lightness values — close enough for web rendering, no color science library required.

## How It Works in Olyx

### 1. Set Your Brand Color

Two variables control everything:

```css
:root {
  --brand-hue: 250;        /* 0–360, your brand's hue */
  --brand-saturation: 60%; /* how vivid */
}
```

### 2. Key Colors Are Derived

From your brand, **five key color groups** are generated — same concept as [Material's key colors](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/system/how-the-system-works):

| Key Color | Hue Derivation | Purpose |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **Primary** | `brand-hue` | High-emphasis elements (buttons, FABs, active states) |
| **Secondary** | `brand-hue + 30°` | Less prominent elements (filter chips, tonal buttons) |
| **Tertiary** | `brand-hue + 60°` | Contrasting accents (badges, input fields) |
| **Neutral** | `brand-hue` at `5%` saturation | Surfaces and backgrounds |
| **Neutral Variant** | `brand-hue` at `15%` saturation | Outlines and surface variants |

### 3. Tones Are Assigned to Roles

Each key color gets mapped to [color roles](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/roles) using specific tone values — light/dark modes simply swap which tones go where:

| Role | Light Tone | Dark Tone | Usage |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| `color-primary` | 40% | 80% | High-emphasis fills, text, icons |
| `color-on-primary` | 100% | 20% | Text/icons **on** primary |
| `color-primary-container` | 90% | 30% | Standout container fills |
| `color-on-primary-container` | 10% | 90% | Text/icons **on** container |

The same pattern repeats for secondary, tertiary, error, surface, and outline groups.

## WCAG Accessibility Guards

The system doesn't just hope for accessibility — it **enforces** it:

- **Saturation is clamped** per color group (e.g., primary: `5%–75%`) to prevent washed-out or over-saturated extremes.
- **Lightness is dynamically adjusted** — high saturation colors get darker lightness values so white text stays readable.
- **Container saturation is reduced** (85% of the main color in light mode, 55% in dark) to keep containers visually recessive.
- **Dark mode boosts minimum lightness** proportionally to saturation, ensuring vibrant colors stay legible on dark backgrounds.

This means you can throw basically any hue/saturation combo at it and the output will be accessible. Not 100% of edge cases — but ~99.99% of reasonable inputs.

## Customizing

Change two variables, everything updates:

```css
:root {
  --brand-hue: 160;       /* switch to teal */
  --brand-saturation: 50%;
}
```

For per-section theming, use the `[data-custom-theme]` attribute on any container:

```html
<section data-custom-theme style="--brand-hue: 340; --brand-saturation: 70%;">
  <!-- this section gets a pink theme -->
</section>
```

Dark mode is handled automatically via `[data-theme="dark"]` — all tone values flip, saturation ratios adjust, and container lightness inverts. No extra work.

## Source

The complete token generation lives in a single CSS file:

<ComponentSource src="assets/styles/_base/colors.css" language="css" title="style/_base/colors.css" />
