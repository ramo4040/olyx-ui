description: Use the Olyx CLI to initialize a project and add UI components.
---

The Olyx CLI ships as the `olyx` command.

- Initialize a project: `olyx init`
- Add components: `olyx add button card dialog`- List components: `olyx list`
If you don’t have it installed globally, you can run it with `npx`:

```bash
npx @olyx/cli@latest init
```

## init

Use `init` to set up Olyx UI in the current folder.

What `init` does:

- Creates (or confirms) your component install directory (default: `src/components/ui`)
- Writes `components.json` with your chosen `componentDir`
- Installs the base style files (`tokens.css` and `colors.css`) into your component directory
- Tries to inject `@import` statements into your global CSS file (when it can detect it)

```bash
olyx init
```

**Help**

```bash
Usage: olyx init [options]

Initialize Olyx UI in your project

Options:
  -h, --help  display help for command
```

Notes:

- If you run `olyx init` in an empty folder (no `package.json`), it offers to scaffold a new project (Next.js, Vite, or TanStack Start) and then continues setup inside the created directory.
- If global CSS injection can’t be done automatically, the CLI prints the exact `@import` lines you need to paste into your global stylesheet.

## add

Use `add` to install one or more components from the registry into your project.

```bash
olyx add button
```

You can add multiple components at once:

```bash
olyx add button card dialog
```

If you run `add` without component names, it opens an interactive picker:

```bash
olyx add
```

What `add` does:

- Ensures your project is initialized (creates `components.json` automatically if missing)
- Fetches the component registry and resolves registry dependencies
- Writes component files into your configured `componentDir`
- Detects your package manager (bun/pnpm/yarn/npm) and installs any required npm dependencies
- Prompts before overwriting existing components

**Help**

```bash
Usage: olyx add [options] [components...]

Add components to your project

Arguments:
  components  Components to add

Options:
  -h, --help  display help for command
```

---

## list

Use `list` to display all available components from the registry.

```bash
olyx list
```

Or with npx:

```bash
npx @olyx/cli@latest list
```

What `list` does:

- Fetches the component registry
- Displays all available UI components in alphabetical order

**Help**

```bash
Usage: olyx list [options]

List all available components

Options:
  -h, --help  display help for command
```

## How the registry is used

Olyx is registry-driven: components are defined in a registry, and the CLI installs files + npm dependencies based on those registry entries.

In this monorepo, the CLI currently reads the local registry file and component sources:

- `apps/web/registry.json`
- `packages/react/src`
